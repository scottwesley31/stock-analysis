## Overview of Project
- The purpose and background are well defined (2 pt).

Explain the purpose of this analysis

After completing a workbook that includes a VBA script which analyses two different worksheets containing stock data from the years 2017 and 2018 respectively, Steve (a client) wants the VBA script refactored. He specificies that the code does not run quickly enough which could be problematic for datasets involving thousands of stocks. The purpose of refactoring the code is to figure out a way to loop through all of the data one time rather than looping through the same dataset multiple times which is how the original VBA script stands.

## Results
- The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the origina script and the refacotred script.

The results of the VBA script times for 2017 and 2018 for both the original and refactored code is as follows:

Original - 2017
